    "# Neuroimaging data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Neuroimaging is the use of quantitative (computational) techniques to scientifically study the brain in a non-invasive manner. There are two broad categories neuroimaging:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Structural imaging to quantify brain structure (e.g {term}`MRI`)\n",

    "---\n",
    "Example {term}`MRI` image\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functional imaging, which is used to study brain function (e.g {term}`PET`, {term}`fMRI`, {term}`MEG`)\n",

    "Example {term}`PET` image\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data formats\n",
    "\n",
    "DICOM (`.dcm`) and NIfTi (`.nii`or `.nii.gz` if gzipped)  are data formats for storing medical images (raw data) along with meta-data in the form of a header. \n",
    "\n",
    "### DICOM\n",
    "\n",
    "DICOM is the sandard file type used for most medical imaging devices ({term}`MRI`? CT, {term}`PET`, etc..) The acronym stands for Digital Imaging and COmmunication in Medicine. DICOM is designed to be transferred and stored with PACS. More information can be found on their [webpage](https://www.dicomstandard.org/about).\n",
    "\n",
    "### NIfTI\n",
    "\n",
    "The Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) is an open file format commonly used to store brain imaging data obtained using Magnetic Resonance Imaging methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is in the header of a NIFTI file?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use `fslinfo` to look at the header of a `nifti` files. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "data_type      FLOAT32 # The decimal precision of the data\n",
    "dim1           166 # Number of voxels in the x-dimension (i.e left-to-right)\n",
    "dim2           256 # Number of voxels in the y-dimension (i.e front-to-back)\n",
    "dim3           256 # Number of voxels in the z-dimension (i.e bottom-to-top)\n",
    "dim4           1 # Number of time-points (volumes concatenated in times series)\n",
    "datatype       16 \n",
    "pixdim1        1.206401 # Size of each voxel in the x-dimension, in mm\n",
    "pixdim2        0.936387 # Size of each voxel in the y-dimension, in mm\n",
    "pixdim3        0.940964 # Size of each voxel in the z-dimension, in mm\n",
    "pixdim4        1.000000 # Size of the time-step (time to acquire each volume)\n",
    "cal_max        0.0000 #  used for mapping dataset values to display colors\n",
    "cal_min        0.0000 # \"\"\n",
    "file_type      NIFTI-1+\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw image data in a NIfTI file is saved as a single 3d image, whereas in DICOM, we have several 2d image slices. NifTi only contains a small subset of the metadata information contained in DICOMs. It is easier for machine learning applications and analyzis to use NIfTi over DICOM\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "For the visualization of {term}`MRI` data, you can use the tools embedded in neuroimagin\n",
    "g software:\n",
    "- FreeSurfer (freeview)\n",
    "- MRtrix (mrview)\n",
    "- FSL (fsleyes).\n",
    "\n",
    "For visualization of {term}`PET` images:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vinci (also works with {term}`MRI`) \n",
    "\n",
    "Commong alternatives found on App Store: BrainView (visualization of segmented T1 images) or MRICro (viewer for nifti data).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Image Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resampling\n",
    "\n",
    "@TODO\n",
    " Resampling and images is changing the resolution and/or dimensions of an image. Images are composed of voxels (three dimensional equivalent of a pixel). Voxels are caled isotropic if all dimensions are of equal lengths, otherwise, they are said to be anisotropic.\n",
    " \n",
    " When resampling we can make the dimensions of the voxels either shorter (to achieve higher resolution) or longer (for lower-resolution images). Resampling is then a numeric approach to reduce or enhace the resolution through approximation algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    " For {term}`MRI` data, each voxel is associated with a number which represents the intensity of the signal measured at that voxel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalizing\n",
    "\n",
    "@TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "Each person's brain is different. When performing neuroimaging studies, it is important to normalize across subjects to adjust the overall size and orientation of images\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nibabel\n",
    "A very powerful python-based tool to access neuro-imaging data (`.nii`, `.dcm` etc.) stored on our file system is [nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/). You can easilly install the latest release of `nibabel` using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install nibabel \n",
    "```"
