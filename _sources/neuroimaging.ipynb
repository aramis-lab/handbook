    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Neuroimaging is the use of quantitative (computational) techniques to scientifically study the brain in a non-invasive manner. There are two broad categories neuroimaging:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Structural imaging to quantify brain structure (e.g MRI)\n",

    "## Data formats\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DICOM (`.dcm`) and NIfTi (`.nii`or `.nii.gz` if gzipped)  are data formats for storing medical images (raw data) along with meta-data in the form of a header. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DICOM\n",
    "\n",
    "DICOM is the sandard file type used for most medical imaging devices (MRIs? CT, PET, etc..) The acronym stands for Digital Imaging and COmmunication in Medicine. DICOM is designed to be transferred and stored with PACS. More information can be found on their [webpage](https://www.dicomstandard.org/about).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NIfTI\n",
    "\n",
    "The Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) is an open file format commonly used to store brain imaging data obtained using Magnetic Resonance Imaging methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is in the header of a NIFTI file?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use `fslinfo` to look at the header of a `nifti` files. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "data_type      FLOAT32 # The decimal precision of the data\n",
    "dim1           166 # Number of voxels in the x-dimension (i.e left-to-right)\n",
    "dim2           256 # Number of voxels in the y-dimension (i.e front-to-back)\n",
    "dim3           256 # Number of voxels in the z-dimension (i.e bottom-to-top)\n",
    "dim4           1 # Number of time-points (volumes concatenated in times series)\n",
    "datatype       16 \n",
    "pixdim1        1.206401 # Size of each voxel in the x-dimension, in mm\n",
    "pixdim2        0.936387 # Size of each voxel in the y-dimension, in mm\n",
    "pixdim3        0.940964 # Size of each voxel in the z-dimension, in mm\n",
    "pixdim4        1.000000 # Size of the time-step (time to acquire each volume)\n",
    "cal_max        0.0000 #  used for mapping dataset values to display colors\n",
    "cal_min        0.0000 # \"\"\n",
    "file_type      NIFTI-1+\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw image data in a NIfTI file is saved as a single 3d image, whereas in DICOM, we have several 2d image slices. NifTi only contains a small subset of the metadata information contained in DICOMs. It is easier for machine learning applications and analyzis to use NIfTi over DICOM\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "For the visualization of MRI data, you can use the tools embedded in neuroimagin\n",
    "g software:\n",
    "- FreeSurfer (freeview)\n",
    "- MRtrix (mrview)\n",
    "- FSL (fsleyes).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For visualization of PET images:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vinci (also works with MRI) \n",
    "\n",
    "Commong alternatives found on App Store: BrainView (visualization of segmented T1 images) or MRICro (viewer for nifti data).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Image Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resampling\n",
    "\n",
    "@TODO\n",
    " Resampling and images is changing the resolution and/or dimensions of an image. Images are composed of voxels (three dimensional equivalent of a pixel). Voxels are caled isotropic if all dimensions are of equal lengths, otherwise, they are said to be anisotropic.\n",
    " \n",
    " When resampling we can make the dimensions of the voxels either shorter (to achieve higher resolution) or longer (for lower-resolution images). Resampling is then a numeric approach to reduce or enhace the resolution through approximation algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    " For MRI data, each voxel is associated with a number which represents the intensity of the signal measured at that voxel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalizing\n",
    "\n",
    "@TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "Each person's brain is different. When performing neuroimaging studies, it is important to normalize across subjects to adjust the overall size and orientation of images\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nibabel\n",
    "A very powerful python-based tool to access neuro-imaging data (`.nii`, `.dcm` etc.) stored on our file system is [nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/). You can easilly install the latest release of `nibabel` using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install nibabel \n",
    "```"
